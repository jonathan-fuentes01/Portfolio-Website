# Portfolio-Website

This is a website that I designed for my portfolio. This is coded in HTML and CSS. I decided to make this website because I needed something to display all of my projects during my undergraduate studies and this would be a way for me to do so. I tried to keep the color scheme minimal, but still enticing.
